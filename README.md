# Open Dollar

This repository contains the core smart contract code for Open Dollar, a GEB fork. GEB is the abbreviation of [GÃ¶del, Escher and Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) as well as the name of an [Egyptian god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb).

## Selecting a Foundry profile

When running `forge`, you can specify the profile to use using the FOUNDRY_PROFILE environment variable. e.g. `export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test && forge test`. Alternatively, you can add `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test` to `.env` and run `source .env`.

## Governance Actions

OpenDollar governance follows the common pattern of:

- proposing a governance action
- queuing the governance action
- executing the governance action

We include a set of governance scripts in `script/gov` which allow DAO members to propose, queue and execute different governance actions.

> NOTE: It is important that you use the `governance` profile when running the different scripts otherwise the reading and writing of JSON files will not work.

### Overview

#### General Files

- [`JSONScript.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/JSONScript.s.sol): provides functionality for building JSON objects for proposing governance actions, parsing the proposal id for queuing proposals and parsing JSON objects for execution of the proposals.

#### Proposing Governance Actions

The current list of governance operations that can be proposed:

- Add Collateral: Adding a new collateral type to the system which can be borrowed against
- Update NFT Renderer: Sets the canonical NFT Renderer contract on Vault721

The input for the proposal is specific to the proposal and what that proposal requires.

The output is always a JSON file which includes at least the following `proposalParams`:

```
{
    "proposalId": uint256,
    "targets": address[],
    "values": uint256[]
    "calldatas": bytes[],
    "description": string,
    "descriptionHash": bytes32
}
```

The JSON output may also include some extra params just for informative purposes.

##### Add Collateral

[`ProposeAddCollateral.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/AddCollateralAction/ProposeAddCollateral.s.sol)

**Required env vars:**

- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: private key of the governance executor
- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `GLOBAL_SETTLEMENT_ADDRESS`: address of the global settlement contract
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_NEW_COLLATERAL_TYPE`: bytes32 value of the new collateral type
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_NEW_COLLATERAL_ADDRESS`: address of the new collateral address
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_MINIMUM_BID`: minimum bid for the collateral auctions (wad)
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_MIN_DISCOUNT`: minimum discount for the collateral auctions (wad %)
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_MAX_DISCOUNT`: maximum discount for the collateral auctions (wad %)
- `ADD_COLLATERAL_PER_SECOND_DISCOUNT_UPDATE_RATE`: Per second rate at which the discount is updated (ray)

This script proposes adding a new collateral to the system (deploys new contracts via the collateral join and collateral auction house factories).

##### Update NFT Renderer

[`ProposeUpdateNFTRenderer.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/UpdateNFTRendererAction/ProposeUpdateNFTRenderer.s.sol)

**Required env vars:**

- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: private key of the governance executor
- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `VAULT_721_ADDRESS`: address of the Vault721 contract
- `ORACLE_RELAYER_ADDRESS`: address of the oracle relayer
- `TAX_COLLECTOR_ADDRESS`: address of the tax collector
- `COLLATERAL_JOIN_FACTORY_ADDRESS`: address of the collateral join factory

This script proposes setting a new NFTRenderer contract on the Vault721 contract (deploys new NFTRenderer contract).

##### Update Block Delay

[`ProposeUpdateBlockDelay.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/UpdateBlockDelayAction/ProposeUpdateBlockDelay.s.sol)

**Required env vars:**

- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: private key of the governance executor
- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `VAULT_721_ADDRESS`: address of the Vault721 contract
- `BLOCK_DELAY`: the number of blocks to wait before being able to transfer after collateral or debt has been updated for allowlisted addresses

This script proposes setting a new block delay on the Vault721 contract.

##### Update Time Delay

[`ProposeUpdateTimeDelay.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/UpdateTimeDelayAction/ProposeUpdateTimeDelay.s.sol)

**Required env vars:**

- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: private key of the governance executor
- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `VAULT_721_ADDRESS`: address of the Vault721 contract
- `TIME_DELAY`: the amount of time to wait before being able to transfer after collateral or debt has been updated for non-allowlisted addresses

This script proposes setting a new time delay on the Vault721 contract.

##### Update PIDController Params

[`ProposeUpdatePidController.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/UpdatePidControllerAction/ProposeUpdatePidController.s.sol)

**Required env vars:**

- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: private key of the governance executor
- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `PID_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS`: address of PID controller
- `SEED_PROPOSER`: new seed proposer address
- `NOISE_BARRIER`: new noise barrier value
- `INTEGRAL_PERIOD_SIZE`: new integral period size value
- `FEEDBACK_OUTPUT_UPPER_BOUND`: new feedback output upper bound value
- `FEEDBACK_OUTPUT_LOWER_BOUND`: new feedback output lower bound value
- `PER_SECOND_CUMULATIVE_LEAK`: new per second cumulative leak value
- `KP`: new kp value
- `KI`: new ki value
- `PRICE_DEVIATION_CUMULATIVE`: new deviation observation integral value

> NOTE: see [`IPIDController.sol`](src/interfaces/IPIDController.sol) for more information about this.

This script proposes updating params on the PIDController contract.

#### Queuing Governance Actions

**Required env vars:**

- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `JSON_FILE_PATH`: the path to the desired JSON proposal file
- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: the private key of the queuer of the governance action

[`QueueProposal.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/QueueProposal.s.sol) is used to queue a proposal given the path of the JSON file which you want, e.g. `export JSON_FILE_PATH=gov-output/1-add-collateral-proposal.json`.

This script extracts the proposal id and queues the proposal via the OD governance contract. This script can be used arbitrarily for any proposal.

#### Executing Governance Actions

**Required env vars:**

- `GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS`: address of OD Governance
- `JSON_FILE_PATH`: the path to the desired JSON proposal file
- `GOV_EXECUTOR_PK`: the private key of the executor of the governance action

[`ExecuteProposal.s.sol`](script/testScripts/gov/ExecuteProposal.s.sol) is used to execute a proposal given the path of the JSON file you want, e.g. `export JSON_FILE_PATH=gov-output/1-add-collateral-proposal.json`.

The script extracts the necessary execution params from the JSON-the same params used during the proposal and executes the proposal. This script can be used arbitrarily for any proposal.

#### Creating a coverage report
coverage reports require lcov to be installed on your system.
 - [lcov for mac/linx](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lcov)


once you have lcov installed run: `anvil` and then in a separate terminal run`yarn test:coverage` to generate a `coverage-report` folder that will contain the html of the coverage report. point your browser to `coverage-report/index.html` to view the report.
