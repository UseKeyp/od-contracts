# Usage

## Basic Setup for Cloned Repo

Run:
`yarn install`,
`yarn build`,
`yarn test`

## Selecting a Foundry profile

When running `forge`, you can specify the profile to use using the FOUNDRY_PROFILE environment variable. e.g. `export FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test && forge test`. Alternatively, you can add `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test` to `.env` and run `source .env`.

# Development

## Anvil

Start Anvil:

```bash
anvil
```

Next, copy the private key from anvil terminal output into your `.env`

```
ANVIL_RPC=http://127.0.0.1:8545
ANVIL_ONE=0x....
```

Deploy the contracts locally:

```bash
yarn deploy:anvil
```

You now have a local anvil test environment with a locally deployed and instantiated version of the Open Dollar Protocol.

> NOTE: You may need to manually verify that all required addresses were updated in `AnvilContracts.t.sol`. The script `parseAnvilDeployments.js` is not perfect.

## Anvil Testing

The following scripts are used to simulate various states of the protocol. The scripts can be found in `script/states` and are described below:

**_DebtState.s.sol_**

- `DebtState.s.sol` puts every SAFE in jeopardy of liquidation by driving the non-wstETH collateral prices down. After
  running DebtState any SAFEs can be liquidated freely for testing.

```
forge script script/states/DebtState.s.sol:DebtState --fork-url http://localhost:8545 -vvvvv
```

**_LiquidationAuction.s.sol_**

- `LiquidationAuction.s.sol` takes DebtState a step further and liquidates every SAFE on the platform. It then initiates
  and completes a single collateral auction. We also create a chunk of unbacked debt in the accounting engine which
  enables launching a debt auction. This state can be used to test liquidations, launching collateral auctions, launching
  a debt auction or viewing a completed collateral auction.

```
forge script script/states/DebtAuction.s.sol:DebtAuction --fork-url http://localhost:8545 -vvvvv
```

**_DebtAuction.s.sol_**

`DebtAuction.s.sol` takes LiquidationAuction a step further and creates a large amount of unbacked debt in the
AccountingEngine; which allows us to then create a debt auction. The debt auction is then bid on and settled. This
allows testing of viewing a completed debt auction.

```
forge script script/states/DebtAuction.s.sol:DebtAuction --fork-url http://localhost:8545 -vvvvv`
```

**_SurplusState.s.sol_**

`SurplusState.s.sol` pushes the clock forward so that the protocol accrues surplus. It can be used to test launching a
SurplusAuction.

```
forge script script/states/SurplusState.s.sol:SurplusState --fork-url http://localhost:8545 -vvvvv
```

**_SurplusAuction.s.sol_**

`SurplusAuction.s.sol` takes SurplusState a step farther, and initiates a surplus auction, bids on it and settles it.
It can be used to test viewing a completed surplus auction.`

```
forge script script/states/SurplusAuction.s.sol:SurplusAuction --fork-url http://localhost:8545 -vvvvv
```

# Tests

## Forge test

`yarn test` will run all tests in the test folder. These tests are pranked on a fork Arbitrum mainnet. Additionally, there are Sepolia deployment tests.

## Coverage Reports with Anvil

Coverage testing is performed using lcov and a local Anvil fork of the contracts. First install [lcov for mac/linx](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lcov).

1. Start Anvil using the instructions above.

2. To generate a report, run the command:

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

3. Open `coverage-report/index.html` to view the report.
